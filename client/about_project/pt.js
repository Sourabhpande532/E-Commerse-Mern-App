@OVERVIEW:
how we can take advantage the base(src/core) file so far everything is going to coming up on our applicat'n
through home & that's aways in the case at least in the application.but we also want to create some sort of templete which loads
nearly in every file you might've notice when you visit any website The footer & navigation bar always remain same weather you visit webpage which is privacy policy, or shopping or card so we need some kind of templeting str. that is usually being inserted in the base
& then inside the base we load all the components home, card, signup, singin & all those stuff.

So, firstly openUp 🗃️Base.js(src/core) 
-🎗️first we'll prepared the Base.js & once this is prepared then we'r go & inject our Home page through
the Base.
-🎗️create rafce
-🎗️create content inside one myName,title,description,children pass it via PROPS 
🎯-from where we grabbed this "children"
🎯-Then, import this Base.js into Home.js & use as COMPONENT 
🎯-children is neccessory for where ever you use 🗃️Base.js file as a COMPONENT & whatsoever content you pass inside one like tags,attributes for showing or demonstate those code Need to pass "children" Best e.g of 🗃️Home.js
