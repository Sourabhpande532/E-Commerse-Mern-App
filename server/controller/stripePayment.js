/*
@REFFERENCE: 
SECRET_KEY COME FROM Stripe dashboard!!
-ðŸŽ¯Need to extract some information via Token from req.body
-ðŸŽ¯token consist of bunch of information that probably we need 
-ðŸŽ¯one more we need access of product also that can also extract from req.body;
-ðŸŽ¯we'll be sharing information from req.body!
-ðŸŽ¯to make sure we get all the product in the array formate use console.log(products);
-ðŸŽ¯Need to loop is mandatory for calculating final ammount 
-ðŸŽ¯for clarification go to fronted check stripeCheckout.js check "getFinalAmount" method

-ðŸŽ¯idempotencyKey it's mandatory to keep this one To not double charge from use it generate id 
-ðŸŽ¯it responsible for not charge($) again it generate uniq id if there is any network issue

Then return is essentional here we create a customer,charge a customer,finally return response back from user! 
-ðŸŽ¯in the response .then() inside once the customer created we'r ready to charge like stripe.charges.create() need to pass information here what ammount you deduct,what currency you charge, & by default you set idempotencyKey
-ðŸŽ¯once after this again call .then() for everything successfully add it
-ðŸŽ¯create
-ðŸŽ¯shipping:{ name:token.cart.name} it further loads a few cart you can grabbed information like that name:token.cart.name(instead .name you can optionally fire this one .address_countrey,.address_currency..read docs)
